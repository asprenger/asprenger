### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
--
I'm a Founder and ML Engineer specialized in machine learning, MLOps, distributed computing and embedded AI. I build machine learning solutions and data products from first prototype to production. I'm working with large language models in commercial projects as well as with embedded AI in a research project. Among other industries I have worked in FX derivative trading, programmatic advertising, e-commerce and agriculture.

#### What I'm currently working on

 * Develop a scalable data analytics platform for a market intelligence solution. Ingest multi-modal data (documents, satellite imagery, geolocation data, etc.) from public and private data sources to extract, index and analyse information. Use large language models to provide a natural language query interface to access the data.
 * Working in a research project that develops a gas sensor based on a array of affinity sensors. The technology will be used to monitor soil quality and detect plant diseases. I'm working on the data analytics part of the project using embedded ML to classify the measurements from the sensor.
